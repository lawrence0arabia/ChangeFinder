# changeFinder
Super simple Python change finder script. 

Modifiable for different variations of currency (eg. 25 cent coins vs 20 cent coins, or removing coins/notes which you don't have at hand).

Default configuration is for Australian Dollars.

If available currency doesn't go small enough it will always round down (gives slightly less change than owed).
